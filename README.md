Project Overview: Facial Keypoint Detection for Game of Thrones Character Filters
The primary goal of this project is to develop a system that detects facial keypoints to enable the addition of Snapchat-like face filters. Specifically, we will focus on adding eyeglasses and moustaches to the popular Game of Thrones characters, Tyrion Lannister and Jaime Lannister.

Facial keypoint detection is a crucial step in many computer vision applications, including augmented reality, facial recognition, and emotion detection. By accurately identifying key facial landmarks, we can overlay digital elements such as eyeglasses and moustaches in real-time, creating engaging and interactive experiences.
